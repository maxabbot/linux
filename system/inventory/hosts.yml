# Inventory file — run playbooks against localhost
#
# Each profile uses a UNIQUE host alias pointing at localhost.
# This ensures a host belongs to exactly ONE profile group at a time,
# so group_vars are applied cleanly without alphabetical-precedence conflicts.
#
# Usage:
#   ansible-playbook playbooks/site.yml -i inventory/hosts.yml -l home_desktop
#   ansible-playbook playbooks/site.yml -i inventory/hosts.yml -l work_laptop
