# Dotfiles staging area

Use these folders to store configuration files that match the packages installed by the scripts:

- `bash/` — login shell configuration.
- `zsh/` — zsh configuration.
- `sway/` — sway or swaylock configs.
- `hyprland/` — Hyprland layouts, Waybar configs, wallpapers.
- `nvim/` — Neovim configuration.

Add, remove, or rename directories as your workflow evolves. The structure is intentionally empty so you can version-control custom dotfiles alongside the setup scripts.
